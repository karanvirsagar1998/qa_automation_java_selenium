1️⃣ Core Java Fundamentals (prerequisite)

Before Selenium, make sure you are comfortable with:

OOP (classes, objects)

methods

loops & conditions

arrays/lists

constructors

string operations

👉 You already know Java basics — so you’re ready.

2️⃣ Locators & XPath Mastery (FOUNDATION of Everything)

This is the MOST IMPORTANT & FIRST topic because:

Every element interaction needs a locator

POM needs locators

Framework needs locators

No XPath → No Selenium

What to learn:

Basic XPath

Dynamic XPath: contains(), starts-with()

Indexing

Axes: following-sibling, ancestor, descendant

Handling complex UIs

👉 You already started — good.

3️⃣ WebDriver + Browser Interaction

Learn how Selenium works:

get()

navigate()

getTitle()

getCurrentUrl()

findElement / findElements

click(), sendKeys()

isDisplayed(), isEnabled()

handling links, buttons, inputs

👉 Simple but essential.

4️⃣ Waits & Synchronization (to avoid flaky scripts)

Learn:

implicit wait

explicit wait

fluent wait

Why Thread.sleep is bad

Waiting for:

element visible

clickable

invisible

attribute changes

👉 This is the difference between real QA and beginner QA.

5️⃣ Handling Windows, Frames, Alerts

Because every real project includes:

switching tabs/windows

switching frames/iframes

handling JS alerts

actions class (hover, drag & drop)

👉 Must learn before framework.

6️⃣ WebDriver Advanced Actions

Actions class

Robot class

JavaScript Executor

Scrolling

Handling hidden elements

File upload/download

You will use these in complex test cases.

7️⃣ TestNG Framework

This is where real automation begins.

Learn:

@Test

@BeforeMethod / @AfterMethod

@BeforeClass / @AfterClass

Assertions

SoftAssert

Groups

Parallel execution

TestNG XML

Retry Analyzer

👉 You cannot build a framework without TestNG.

8️⃣ Page Object Model (POM)

After TestNG, build:

Page classes

PageFactory

Reusable methods

No duplication

Clean test scripts

👉 POM is asked in every interview.

9️⃣ Data-Driven Testing

Using:

Excel

JSON

Properties file

TestNG DataProvider

👉 Required for real-world projects.

🔟 Automation Framework Architecture (FINAL & MOST IMPORTANT)

Bring everything together:

BaseTest

BasePage

DriverManager

Logger

Utilities: wait, screenshot

Reusable methods

Test structure

Reporting

👉 This is what companies EXPECT you to know.
