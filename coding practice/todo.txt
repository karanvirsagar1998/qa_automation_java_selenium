🔥 CODING & TECHNICAL QUESTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)
🧠 SECTION 1: Core Java Coding Questions

These test whether you can actually write Java — not just talk.

1️⃣ Reverse a String (without using reverse())
Input: "Selenium"
Output: "muineleS"


Follow-ups they may ask:

Using recursion?

Using StringBuilder?

Time complexity?

2️⃣ Find duplicate characters in a String
Input: "automation"
Output: a, t, o


They check:

Use of Map

Clean logic

Edge cases

3️⃣ Find the largest / second largest number in an array
int[] arr = {10, 45, 2, 99, 23};

4️⃣ Check if a number is palindrome
Input: 121 → true
Input: 123 → false

5️⃣ Count vowels in a String
Input: "Cognizant"
Output: 3

6️⃣ Sort an array without using built-in sort

They check:

Bubble sort understanding

Loops & swapping

7️⃣ Difference between == and .equals() (with code)

They WILL ask you to write code and explain output.

🧠 SECTION 2: Java OOP & Framework Coding

These test how you design automation frameworks.

8️⃣ Write a BaseTest class

They expect:

WebDriver initialization

Browser parameterization

Teardown

public class BaseTest {
    protected WebDriver driver;

    @BeforeMethod
    public void setup() {
        driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.manage().window().maximize();
    }

    @AfterMethod
    public void tearDown() {
        driver.quit();
    }
}

9️⃣ Create a Page Object Model class

They want to see:

Locators

Actions

No test logic

🔟 How would you design a reusable click method with wait?

They expect something like:

public void click(WebElement element) {
    new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10))
        .until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(element))
        .click();
}

🧠 SECTION 3: Selenium Practical Coding Questions

These are VERY common.

1️⃣1️⃣ Write code to handle a dropdown (3 ways)

Select class

Click options

JavaScript

1️⃣2️⃣ Handle alerts (accept, dismiss, get text)

They may ask:

“How do you know if OK or Cancel was clicked?”

1️⃣3️⃣ Switch between multiple windows and close child window
1️⃣4️⃣ Explicit wait for dynamic element
1️⃣5️⃣ Take screenshot on failure

They expect:

TakesScreenshot

Save with timestamp

1️⃣6️⃣ Read data from Excel

They check:

Apache POI basics

Data-driven testing concept

🧠 SECTION 4: TestNG Coding Tasks

They WILL ask these if you say “I know TestNG”.

1️⃣7️⃣ Write a TestNG XML for parallel execution
<suite parallel="tests" thread-count="3">

1️⃣8️⃣ Implement RetryAnalyzer

They want working logic.

1️⃣9️⃣ Use SoftAssert in a test case
2️⃣0️⃣ Group tests and run only "smoke"
🧠 SECTION 5: Debugging & Scenario Questions (VERY REAL)

These separate juniors from professionals.

2️⃣1️⃣ Test passes locally, fails in Jenkins — why?

Expected answers:

Headless mode issues

Timing issues

Resolution

Environment mismatch

2️⃣2️⃣ Locator keeps changing daily — what will you do?

They expect:

Ask dev for data-testid

Use stable parent/child

Avoid index-based XPath

2️⃣3️⃣ How would you automate a CAPTCHA page?

Correct answer:

CAPTCHA should NOT be automated — validate functionality via API or bypass in test env.

2️⃣4️⃣ How do you handle flaky tests?

Expected:

Proper waits

Retry logic

Remove Thread.sleep

Logging + screenshots

🧠 SECTION 6: API + DB Technical Questions

Even if UI role, they test awareness.

2️⃣5️⃣ Write a simple RestAssured GET request
2️⃣6️⃣ Validate JSON response fields
2️⃣7️⃣ JDBC code to fetch data
🧠 SECTION 7: Trick Questions (VERY IMPORTANT)

Interviewers love these.

2️⃣8️⃣ Why Thread.sleep is bad?
2️⃣9️⃣ Can Selenium automate mobile apps?
3️⃣0️⃣ Difference between Selenium Grid and parallel execution?
🎯 MOST IMPORTANT ADVICE (This Wins Jobs)

When answering coding questions:

✔ Write clean code
✔ Explain why you chose that approach
✔ Talk while coding
✔ Mention real project usage

Example:

“I use this method in my framework to avoid flaky tests.”
